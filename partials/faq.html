            <div class="question">Can I use custom reference curves for 14C and AM data?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Currently, there is no way to import new reference curves from the Chronomodel user interface.</p>
                <p>
                    However, reference curves are placed in a folder during the application installation, so you can add your own curve files in this folder.
                    You can have a look at the existing files to understand how to build yours (we don't provide any specification about it).
                    Malformed curve files may break Chronomodel at runtime : check their in this case!

                    Mac OS X : reference files are placed inside the application bundle, in the "Calib" folder. (right-click on Chronomodel.app => Display Content)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Windows : reference files are placed inside the "Calib" folder, located in Program Files => Chronomodel.

                <p>No, not at the moment. We will work on that soon!</p>

            <div class="question">What are the system requirements?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Chronomodel can be very demanding on system resources depending on your models. If you create hundreds of objets and launch calculations with millions of iterations, your Random Access Memory will have to be large enough. Your CPU speed controls the calculation time but won't prevent Chronomodel from running correctly.</p>
                <p>We don't provide a "minimal" system requirement since simple models will run on almost all configurations.</p>
                <p>The application can be built for Mac OS X (10.7 and more), Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8) and Linux (tested on Ubuntu).</p>

            <div class="question">What is the minimum screen size?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Chronomodel has many functionalities so we recomand at least a 13-inches screen to be able to see everything. This said, screens display may vary depending on the currently used resolution or the number of dots per pixel... So sometimes, 11 inches may be OK! The best is to try and see...</p>
